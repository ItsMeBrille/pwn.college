Welcome to ASMLevel25
==================================================

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it to see the challenge instructions.
Then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

For instance, if you write your assembly code in the file asm.S, you can assemble that to an object file:
  as -o asm.o asm.S

Note that if you want to use Intel syntax for x86 (which, of course, you do), you'll need to add the following to the start of asm.S:
  .intel_syntax noprefix

Then, you can copy the .text section (your code) to the file asm.bin:
  objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin

And finally, send that to the challenge:
  cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

You can even run this as one command:
  as -o asm.o asm.S && objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text ./asm.o ./asm.bin && cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run

In this level you will be working with control flow manipulation. This involves using instructions
to both indirectly and directly control the special register `rip`, the instruction pointer.
You will use instructions such as: jmp, call, cmp, and their alternatives to implement the requested behavior.

We will be testing your code multiple times in this level with dynamic values! This means we will
be running your code in a variety of random ways to verify that the logic is robust enough to
survive normal use.



We will now introduce you to conditional jumps--one of the most valuable instructions in x86.
In higher level programming languages, an if-else structure exists to do things like:
  if x is even:
    is_even = 1
  else:
   is_even = 0

This should look familiar, since it is implementable in only bit-logic, which you've done in a prior level.

In these structures, we can control the program's control flow based on dynamic values provided to the program.

Implementing the above logic with jmps can be done like so:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; assume rdi = x, rax is output
; rdx = rdi mod 2
mov rax, rdi
mov rsi, 2
div rsi
; remainder is 0 if even
cmp rdx, 0
; jump to not_even code is its not 0
jne not_even
; fall through to even code
mov rbx, 1
jmp done
; jump to this only when not_even
not_even:
mov rbx, 0
done:
mov rax, rbx
; more instructions here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often though, you want more than just a single 'if-else'.

Sometimes you want two if checks, followed by an else.

To do this, you need to make sure that you have control flow that 'falls-through' to the next `if` after it fails.

All must jump to the same `done` after execution to avoid the else.

There are many jump types in x86, it will help to learn how they can be used.

Nearly all of them rely on something called the ZF, the Zero Flag.

The ZF is set to 1 when a cmp is equal. 0 otherwise.

Using the above knowledge, implement the following:
  if [x] is 0x7f454c46:
    y = [x+4] + [x+8] + [x+12]
  else if [x] is 0x00005A4D:
    y = [x+4] - [x+8] - [x+12]
  else:
    y = [x+4] * [x+8] * [x+12]

where:
  x = rdi, y = rax.

Assume each dereferenced value is a signed dword.
This means the values can start as a negative value at each memory position.

A valid solution will use the following at least once:
  jmp (any variant), cmp

We will now run multiple tests on your code, here is an example run:
  (data) [0x404000] = {4 random dwords]}
  rdi = 0x404000

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):
